          <h3>
            Can I get an estimate?
          </h3>
          <p>
            You sure can. Estimates are free for both lawn and window services.

        <div class="question">
          <h3>
            How much will it cost to clean all the windows in my house?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The cost of the services varies greatly on factors like 1-2 stories,
            window size, glass doors, etc. As a general rule however, the going
            price is 5 dollars per window. This means both sides of a pane would
            cost 10 dollars. Multiply this amount by however panes of glass you
            have in your household, and you will get a general ballpark.

          <h3>
            How much will it cost to mow my lawn?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We have a flat rate of $30 for every service, adding an additional
            $20 dollars for each hour after the first spent on mowing the lawn.

          <h3>
            What areas do you provide your services too?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our business Is based in Galt, Ca. Our services extend in an 18-mile
            radius in all directions from this point. This means our services

          <h3>
            Are there any discounts?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We do, and you can make an account with us at request. This will
            ensure that your lawn is always kept up with, and you can opt-out of
            any service you feel that you don’t need. Most accounts are weekly
            or bi-monthly for lawn care, and every 3 months for window cleaning
            services.
